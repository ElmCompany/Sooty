Online streaming Player, designed as **SouldCloud** client 

I believe that, online services should have a desktop clients for better user experience.  

Web is god, but for not all purposes, it might for online publishing, corporate businesses, but for personal staff, desktop clients would be better.

**SoundCloud** is one online service that I uses a lot - and many of my colleague - and I tried to find a good/simple desktop client - in this case it is mac- but I couldn't.

So, I started writing my own.

###Sooty is
  - a streaming sound player that you can use to listen to audio (Quraan, different sounds ....) on your mac.  
  - It is designed to be configurable to be used with different audio streaming services as well.   
  For example, **Sooty** is using [**SootyService** ](https://github.com/MuhammadHewedy/SootyService "SootyService") which is a simlation service used to simulate the audio provider services. (built mainly for development purposes)
