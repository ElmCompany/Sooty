Sooty
=====

Online streaming Player, designed as SouldCloud client 

I believe that, online services should have a desktop clients for better user experience.

Web is god, but for not all purposes, it might for online publishing, corporate businesses, but for personal staff, desktop clients would be better.

SoundCloud is one online service that I uses a lot - and many of my colleague - and I tried to find a good/simple desktop client - in this case it is mac- but I couldn't.

So, I started writing my own.

Sooty is a streaming sound player that you can use to listen to audio (Quraan, different sounds ....) on your mac.

Sooty is designed to be configurable to be used with different audio streaming services as well.
