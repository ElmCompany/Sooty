I believe that, online services should have a desktop clients for better user experience.  

Web is god, but for not all purposes, it might be suitable for online publishing, corporate businesses, but for personal staff, desktop clients would be better.

**SoundCloud** is one online service that I uses a lot - and many of my colleague - and I tried to find a good/simple desktop client - in this case it is mac- but I couldn't.

So, I started writing my own.

###Sooty is
  - a streaming sound player that you can use to listen to audio (Quraan, different sounds ....) on your mac.  
  - It is designed to be configurable to be used with different audio streaming services as well.   
  For example, **Sooty** is using [**SootyService** ](https://github.com/MuhammadHewedy/SootyService "SootyService") which is a simlation service used to simulate the audio provider services. (built mainly for development purposes)
